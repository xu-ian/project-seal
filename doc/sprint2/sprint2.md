Updated Estimate: 60

*A revote was put up in case we were allowed to use open source resources.

**Spikes:**


*   Connecting Backend to Frontend
    *   As the tasks were divided to frontend and backend, the connection from backend to frontend can take time. 
*   Feature Dependency
    *   Features that depended to another user story caused delay in progresssion (e.g. Seal 37 to Seal 19)
*   Redundant Task
    *   Some user stories has overlapped features (e.g. Seal 16 & 19) to be implemented.
    *   Redundant and unnecessary coding due to overlapped feature
    *   Conflict in merging due to differences in implementing style
*   Collaborating with others to test our features
    *   Testing these features required merging of branches
    *   Due to the individual work flow, this may be time consuming and conflict prone
