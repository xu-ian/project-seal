## New User Stories

* As a user, I want to create posts that also display my user information, so that other people are able to find out about me.
* As a user, I want to be recognized in the client after I've logged in, so that I can access other resources under my account.
* As a user, I want all features to be in one branch, so that I can navigate through the website easily.

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?
Most of our members agreed that having frequent meetings was beneficial to our team, and should be longer (if needed) 
to keep the team updated with their work and whatnot. These meetings also allowed other members to reveal any blockers 
they had with their work, which allowed other team members to help resolve these blockers. Furthermore, some members who 
worked on the same feature together agreed that separating work into front-end and back-end was good practice as it allowed 
each member to work on something that they were better at, instead of just splitting the work in half (with no division of 
front-end and back-end). Lastly, members have also said that it was good that the team came together to fix any conflicts 
before merging code, as it helped ensure that all our features were working.

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint?
One of the new practices that our team wants to use for the next sprint is splitting up work based on the front-end and back-end. 
This would help members work on something that they excelled in and save more time when working on features. Furthermore, regularly 
testing our code before we push it is another practice that we want to use for the next sprint. Lastly, having discussions regarding 
the style of the features is needed since each feature had different styling, making the style inconsistent throughout the features. 
We will need to discuss the styling beforehand so that it looks uniform and consistent next time.

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint?
One harmful practice that members generally agreed on was leaving work to the last minute; this left us little time to merge all our 
code before the demo, and thus we had to present each of our features separately. It also prevented us from being able to double-check our 
work. Also, pushing commits without testing is another harmful practice that was brought up. As stated previously, testing rigorously 
before each push is a practice that we want to adopt for the next sprints. Furthermore, starting with no starter code or any tutorials 
was quite difficult for members, as we were unable to figure out where exactly to begin. 

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1?
Our team unanimously agreed that getting our code to work and having other team members help with any blockers was the best experience during Sprint 1. 
Some members also found it engaging to merge all our code, which allowed a deeper understanding of the code. Our collective worst experience was merging everything; 
there were plenty of conflicts that needed to be resolved, and thus members had to work together to resolve these conflicts.
