*A revote was put up in case we were allowed to use open source resources.

**Spikes:**



*   Merging files together into one coherent project
    *   This may be difficult as all members are working somewhat individually
    *   Time estimate for this can vary greatly
*   Collaborating with others to test our features
    *   Many features are linked to one another (e.g. Seal 1 & 2)
    *   Testing these features required merging of branches
    *   Due to the individual work flow, this may be time consuming and conflict prone
*   Github and branch management
    *   Some members are new to Git and Github as well as the mern stack
    *   Getting familiar with these systems may take some time and differs from person to person
*   Coherent styling and navigation
    *   To form a complete demo, coherent styling and navigation between feature should be done
    *   Due to the aforementioned individual based workflow this may be a problem
    *   Styling and navigation features (e.g. sidebars, navbars, etc.) may not be compatible with other features and remodeling may have to be done
