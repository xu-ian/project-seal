## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?
Our members have unanimously agreed that there are two practices that are highly beneficial to our team. The first practice is having frequent meetings; 
these meetings allow us to communicate to our members what we've been working on, what we plan to work on next, and any issues we're facing. These helps
our members significantly and allows us to be kept up to date with what each member has been working on. The second practice is splitting work between the 
front-end and the back-end; doing this allows our members to work on tasks that they specialize in.

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint?
One new practice that our members want to try is to push our changes to the repository as early as possible. This would allow us to see what our members 
have been working on. Furthermore, this would solve a harmful practice that we have been continuing these past sprints, detailed in the next question.

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint?
Our members agree that submitting our work and leaving the merging to the last day has been a harmful practice to our team. By doing so, we are not leaving
plenty of time for us to double check our work and to check if everything is working the way it is supposed to work. This has been a practice that has been
present throughout our previous sprints, caused by other coursework and/or other time conflicts. Some of our members who were affected by such time conflicts 
also say that they ended up doing more work than they could manage, and should have redistributed work to other members in order to prevent blocking
other tickets.

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 3?
Most of our members said that getting their code to work was their best experience in Sprint 3. Others have said that learning more about other technologies 
for this sprint has also been an enjoyful experience as they learnt more about other interesting technologies. Some of our members' worst experience was
doing more work than they could handle.
