# Process

## Team Organization

We mainly used Google Drive and Discord to organize our team; Google Drive was used for organizing our deliverables and Discord was our 
main communication hub. Furthermore, when we formed the team, we immediately appointed a team leader who would help guide the team and 
make decisions for us when needed. 

## Decision Making 

When we needed to assign work, we first allowed team members to volunteer for the deliverable that they wanted to work on. If there were 
team members that were fine with working on anything, the team leader appointed tasks to each member. For other decisions, we discussed 
these during meetings and came to a consensus.

## Estimating User Stories

We plan on estimating our user stories at the beginning of Sprint 1.

## Meetings

We met twice a week to discuss the work we needed to do for Sprint 0. We scheduled our meetings accordingly which allowed us to assign and 
review each team memberâ€™s work and submit the deliverables on time. 

## Lessons for Next Phases

While working on Sprint 0, our team did not run into any major problems, and thus were able to quickly complete our work. Thus, we plan on continuing 
the routine we had been following for Sprint 0 to better ensure success in the following sprints. Our team worked together quite well since we organized 
meetings frequently, which allowed us to complete each of our work on time. We will continue to hold meetings whenever needed to continue the smooth work 
we have completed thus far.
