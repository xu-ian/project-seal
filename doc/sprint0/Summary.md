# Objective

This project hopes to create a communication and e-learning platform for aspiring african entrepreneurs to create their startups. This project focuses on creating a center for communication between all users, a classroom for founders to learn and teachers to teach, and a place to find startups to invest in.

# Key Personas

## Startup Founder

Hagan Furaha is a 30 year old, male, software engineer who started a startup company half a year ago with two other partners. He lacks the proper knowledge and a source of funding for his startup company. He is looking for a platform that gathers entrepreneurs and investors alike so that he may communicate with others and find solutions to problems that may occur during the early stages of his companyâ€™s life. He would be pleased if this platform provides a learning environment to give him advice on how to build his company, but his main goal is finding investors that will invest in his company.
