**Competition**

Some of our potential competitors are Facebook, Piazza, Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Discord. As well as more e-learning orientated platforms such as Skillshare.

**Differences**

There are some common differences between the competitors and our project. Namely, the difference in target audiences and the goal of the platforms. Most if not all of the aforementioned platforms are made with larger populations in mind.

- **Social Media Focused Competition** : Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Discord
  - Focused more on the community aspect, no e-learning infrastructure
- **E-Learning Focused Competition** : Skillshare
  - Focused more on e-learning, lack of community infrastructure
- **Direct Competitor** : LinkedIn
  - No Assignment Submissions
  - Not focused on a tight knit community

**Why didn&#39;t competitors focus on these users and or scenarios?**

- Designed for fundamentally different uses
  - Our target users are narrow in scope and differ greatly from our competitors
- Relatively new field/scenarios
- Emerging market, lack of established infrastructure

**What would it take for them to do so?**

For our competitors to focus on these users and scenarios would require a paradigm shift in business plan. Firstly, a massive capital investment is necessary to overhaul their platform to include the missing infrastructure, whether that is e-learning or community/business and discovery. Next, they must be willing to lose many of its current users as the platform shifts their focus away from them. If they are willing to accept all of the previously mentioned issues, they must next convince their shareholders and boards to change their business model.

In summary, for our competitors to focus on these new users and scenarios, they must solve these issues:

- Profitability
  - Is it possible or does it makes sense to adapt/change existing product to accommodate these new users and scenarios
- Repercussions
  - What harm might these changes bring to exist products
  - How will existing users treat these changes
- Bureaucracy
  - A large amount of paperwork and negotiations must be settled to handle the shift
  - This will further decrease the profitability and also delay the project
