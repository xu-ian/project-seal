## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?
All of our members have agreed that splitting up work between the front-end and the back-end has been highly beneficial to our team. By continuing this practice, 
our members are able to focus on whatever they are more specifically skilled in. Members have also agreed that frequent meetings should continue as it allows members to
learn about each others' progress and any issues that they are facing with their work.

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint?
Some new practices that our members wanted to use was to add CI/CD in order to check for errors whenever a member opens a PR. Furthermore, members also want to better organize
the organization of files and folders, as some members experienced having their files connect to the wrong ones. Furthermore, members also want the user stories to be more clearly
defined, as there is some overlap between user stories. For example, SEAL-16 and SEAL-19 had plenty of overlap, which caused some issues. Lastly, all members agree that submitting
work earlier would be highly beneficial to the team as it leaves more time to connect the front-end to the back-end, more time for merging, and more time for other work related
to the sprint.

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint?
All members agree that one harmful practice that should be stopped during the next sprint is submitting work last minute. As said in the previous question, sumbitting our work
late led to less time for connecting the front-end to back-end, merging, and other work. Thus, it is in the best interest for the entire team to submit work as early as possible
in order to prevent the above issues from happening again.

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2?
All members enjoyed learning new things related to the feature they were working on, i.e. how to get their corresponding features to work. They also enjoyed learning more about
new functionality with the technologies that they were working with. Our members' worst experience was dealing with bugs and errors that they had trouble figuring out the solution to,
and trying to figure out why new solutions that they are trying to implement aren't working.
