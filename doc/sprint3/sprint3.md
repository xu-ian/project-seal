Updated Estimate: 37

*A revote was put up in case we were allowed to use open source resources.

**Spikes:**


*   Connection between Backend to Frontend
    *   As the tasks were divided to the frontend and the backend, the connection between the backend to frontend can take time, Especially, it could take more time to figure out where the code broke between the frontend and backend when there is a bug in one end. 
    *   The project member's scheduling differences in working on the project might form a blocker to the team member as the frontend and backend are interdependent. 
*   Collaborating with others to test our features
    *   Testing these features required merging of branches
    *   Due to the individual work flow, this may be time consuming and conflict prone
*   Merging files together into one coherent project
    *   This may be difficult as all members are working somewhat individually
    *   Time estimate for this can vary greatly
